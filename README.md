# Risk-BoardGame

## Overview
In this assignment you are asked to implement a simple environment simulator that generates
instances of a search problem, runs agent programs, and evaluates their performance according
to a simple performance measure. The search problem we will use is a simplified and abstract
version of the board game RISK. Before reading on to the rest of the assignments, be sure you
understand the rules of the full version of the game. The following discussion will discuss how
the rules of the simplified, abstract game differ from the full version of the game.
